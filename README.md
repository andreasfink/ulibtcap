# The Universal Libary: TCAP

ulib is a collection of generic useful Objective-C classes which can be used on macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, Linux and probably many other Unixes. It builds on top of Foundation under Apple operating systems and GnuStep's base under Linux. It also used to work  with Cocotron in the past.

ulibtcap implements the TCAP layer of SS7 according to ITU-T and ANSI. It's  the layer5 of the ulib based universal SS7 stack
